First thoughts: 

This is just a side project for my own personal benefit that helps me practice coding in python

CaloriesChecker:

1) user inputs gender, age, weight, height, activity level
2) user chooses case: lose weight, maintain, gain
3) maintenance eq: BMR(men) =  13.397W + 4.799H - 5.677A + 88.362, BMR(women) = 9.247W + 3.098H - 4.330A + 447.593
                              (W in kg, H in cm)
                   multiply this BMR by an activity level between 1.2 and 1.9
4) lose weight: ranges from BMR - 1000 to BMR - 500
5) gain: ranges from BMR + 250 to BMR + 500
6) output calorie range per day


activity multiplier: sedentary = 1.2
                     lightly active = 1.375
                     moderately active = 1.55
                     very active = 1.725
                     extra active = 1.9
                     
                     
                     
MealPlanner:

1) TODO: find spreadsheet/file with a lot of macronutrient data for popular recipes
2) find all combinations of 4 meals/day that satisfies a) calorie restrictions given in CaloriesChecker
                                                       b) macronutrients
3) outputs all possible options for the 4 meals and the total daily macros/calories

This app will have ...

- a calorie calculator
- an interactive calendar
- a daily list view where the user can input exercises, sets, reps, weight, etc
- a progress tab telling the user how they started vs how its going
- potentially more features

- a calorie calculator

- a daily list view

This app needs ...

- improved UI
- a progress tab which shows progress from start week, present, and sets reasonable goal recommendations for next week
- improved options for prefilling daily list view headers (push day every week, every 3 days, etc). This will help with the progress tab too
